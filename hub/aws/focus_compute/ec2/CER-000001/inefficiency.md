# Idle EC2 Instances

## Summary
EC2 instances running with low or no utilization incur unnecessary compute costs.

## Why this matters
Idle instances often go unnoticed and continue to accrue hourly charges.

## Common signals
- CPU utilization consistently below 5%
- No network traffic
- Instance tagged as non-production

## Recommended action
Stop, right-size, or terminate unused instances after validation.
